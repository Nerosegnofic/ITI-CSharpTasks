TaskDay1inEF: Create Desktop Application with CRUD Operations using DB Approach

Objective:
Develop a Desktop Application (using .NET WinForms/WPF) to manage a dataset. 
The application should provide full CRUD functionality with clean and maintainable code.

Requirements:

Data Management:

Display data in a grid/table format.

Implement CRUD Operations:

Create → Add new record.

Read → View records in a DataGrid.

Update → Edit existing records.

Delete → Remove records.

UI & UX Enhancements:

Clear layout with labels, textboxes, and buttons.

DataGrid should auto-refresh after operations.

Validation before saving/updating data.

Code Quality:

Apply Clean Code Principles (e.g., separation of concerns, reusable methods).

Use a Repository Layer for data handling instead of direct operations inside the UI code.

Proper naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.

Button Visibility & State Management:

Buttons should be enabled/disabled depending on the current state:

Add visible when no item is selected.

Update/Delete enabled only when an item is selected.

Reset/Clear button should appear after editing/adding.

Testing:

Ensure that all CRUD operations work correctly.

Validate visibility and state management of buttons.

Deliverables:

Fully functional Desktop Application project (WinForms/WPF).
